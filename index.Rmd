## **Motivation**
*** 

According to this [report](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/Making%20the%20Connection.pdf) youth disconnection although generally showing decreasing trends for the past 7 years, shows **racial and ethnic disparities**, where some groups are showing increased rates of disconnection.

So what does the term **"youth disconnection"** mean?

According to [Measure of America](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/view/moa/){target="_blank"} (a nonpartisan project of the nonprofit [Social Science Research Council](https://www.ssrc.org/){target="_blank"} that is focused on opportunity in the United States) disconnected youth are:

> "young people between the ages of **16 and 24** who are **neither working nor in school**"

They state that such disconnection hinders these individuals to aquire skills and create relationships necessary to have a sucessful adulthood. 

They state that:

> "people who experience a period of disconnection as young adults go on to **earn less** and are **less likely** to be **employed, own a home, or report good health** by the time they reach their thirties"

Disconnected youth are also referred to as **opportunity youth**, which has the added positive connotation that promoting such individuals can be beneficial not only for these individuals but also for their communties and for society. 

We will expand beyond the [Measure of America annual report](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/Making%20the%20Connection.pdf){target="_blank"} to take a deeper look at differences of specific groups of youths. Identifying youths particularly at risk or disconnected, can help inform the design of targeted prevention and rengagement strategies.

This case study is motivated by this [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6243446/){target="_blank"}:

####
 
This [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6243446/){target="_blank"} describes strategies for prevention of disconnection and reengagement of discconnected youth and how such interventions could greatly positively impact opportunity youth for the entire trajectory of their lives and for future generations. It also points out that indeed their are disparities among different racial/ethnic groups.


## **Main Questions**
*** 

#### {.main_question_block}
<b><u> Our main questions: </u></b>

1) How have youth disconnection rates in American youth changed since 2008?   
2) In particular, how has this changed for different gender and ethnic groups? Are any groups particularly disconnected? 

####

## **Learning Objectives** 
*** 

In this case study, we will demonstrate how to import and wrangle data available in the <u>**P**</u>ortable <u>**D**</u>ocument <u>**F**</u>ormat (**PDF**). We will especially focus on using packages and functions from the [`Tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}, such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`. The tidyverse is a library of packages created by RStudio. While some students may be familiar with previous R programming packages, these packages make data science in R more legible and intuitive.

The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by the end of this case study are:

Data science skills:  

1. Importing data from PDF files using the `magick` package  
2. Apply action verbs in `dplyr` for data wrangling  
3. How to pivot between "long" and "wide" datasets (`tidyr`)  
4. Joining together multiple datasets using `dplyr`  
5. How to create data visualizations with `ggplot2` that are in a similar style to an existing image  

Statistical concepts and methods:  

1. Implementation of the Mann-Kendall trend test  
2. Interpretation of the Mann-Kendall trend test

## **Context**
*** 

So how does youth disconnection happen and what impact does it have?


There are many known **risk factors**, which have been identified in a variety of contexts (from family, friends, school, community, society) including:  

 - poverty (disconnected youth are nearly twice as likely to live in poverty and receive Medicaid)  
 - racial/ethnic disparities (findings suggest that these persist even when controlling for income)  
 - residential environment (in 2016 while 11.7% was the national average, 24% of people age 16-24 in the rural South were disconnected)  
 - poor academic performance  
 - poor mental health  
 - substance use disorders  
 - parental unemployment  
 - trauma exposure  
 - association with socially deviant peers 
 - school policies such as "one strike and you're out" - which is a zero tolerance school expulsion policy and shown to increase dropouts and incarceration rates
 
 These risk factors make it more likely for young people to miss out on education, training, and networking that can act as a foundation for a sucessful career.
 
There are also many known **negative consequences** associated with youth disconnection including but not limited to:

- chronic unemployment
- poverty
- poor menthal health and poor general health (in a 2002 study - youths discoonected for 6 or more months were 3 times more likely to develop depression or other mental health disorder)
- crimial behavior (in a 2002 study - youths discoonected for 6 or more months were 5 times more likely to have a criminal record)
- incarceration
- early mortality

Furthermore, in 2012 it was estimated that each disconnected youth costs taxpayers $250000 during a life time due to lost tax revenue and costs for social sercices, heath care and criminal justice.

Youth disconnection can be described as a continuum, as some youths will be disconnected for a brief time, while others are chronically disconnected. Additionally, while an individual who is out of school and work and also has poor support from the realtionships of others may be further disconnected than an individual who has social support.

Here is an illustration of risk factors, protective factors and the continuum of disconnection:

### Strategies to mitigate youth disconnection

Many programs have identified useful strategies in rengaging disconnected youth or preventing discconection of youth. 

generally speaking, most programs focus on reengagement strategies, however, prevention strategies are likely to be just as important. 

Reserach suggests that active involvement with at risk youth from infancy and across multiple developmental stages through young adulthood whould be the most beneficial.

In fact, the quality of parental caregiving of infants age 6-24 months has actually been shown to be a predictor of high school dropout rates! Thus early interventions may be very important and consistent continual engagement may prevent further disconnection of youths.

Prevention strategies include:  

- Preschool  
- [The Good Behavior Game](https://www.goodbehaviorgame.org/good-behavior-game-what-is-it){target="_blank"}  
- Strengthening family and community connections  
- Promoting academic and career engagement  
- Life skills training for youths and families  
- Education about substance abuse  
- [Cognitive behavioral therapy](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral){target="_blank"}

## **Limitations**
*** 

There are some important considerations regarding this data analysis to keep in mind: 

1) This data used in the [Measure of America](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/view/moa/){target="_blank"}  project reports from the is derived from [American Community Survey(ASC)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs){target="_blank"} which excludes or underrepresents certain opportunity youth groups, such as youths in the juvenile justice system, youths in the foster care system, and homeless youths as the survey is conducted on households. Furthermore, youths who may be more disconnected for other reasons besides not being in work or school, such as dealing with the added challenge of being a teenage mother, or being abused is not available in this dataset. Thus, this data likely underestimates youth disconnection rates. 

2) Data about certain group [intersections](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination){target="_blank"} (meaning for example individuals of a particular gender and ethnicity) or particular groups in general such as specific ethnicities or gender or sexual identity groups such as LGBT (lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender/queer and questioning) or nonbinary gender populations is unfortunately not available in the data used in this analysis and in most research about this topic. Luckily however, recent years of the [ACS survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs){target="_blank"} has more detailed infromation about a greater number of racial and ethnic groups and racial/ethnic intersections.

3) The statistical procedures we are using may be overly simplistic. *In all data analysis, we need to be wary about deriving meaning from the statistical procedures we use*.

4) Using image processing tools can be very helpful. The manner in which data is obtained with image processing tools is what we would describe as a **black box process**, <u>*a process with known inputs and outputs but unknown mechanics*</u>. Because we are unaware of how our outputs are generated from our inputs, we need to be wary of the output. With the small output we are creating in this case study, a visual inspection should suffice. 


## **What are the data?**
*** 

In this case study we will be using data related to youth disconnection from the two following reports from the [Measure of America](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/view/moa/){target="_blank"}  project:

> Measure of America is a nonpartisan project of the nonprofit [Social Science Research Council](https://www.ssrc.org/){target="_blank"}  founded in 2007 to create easy-to-use yet methodologically sound tools for understanding well-being and opportunity in America. Through reports, interactive apps, and custom-built dashboards, Measure of America works with partners to breathe life into numbers, using data to identify areas of highest need, pinpoint levers for change, and track progress over time.

1. Lewis, Kristen. [Making the Connection: Transportation and Youth Disconnection](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/Making%20the%20Connection.pdf){target="_blank"} . New York: Measure of America, Social Science Research Council, 2019.  (Data up to 2017)

```{r, out.width="400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "Making_the_Connection.png"))
```

2. : Lewis, Kristen. [A Decade Undone: Youth Disconnection in the Age of Coronavirus](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/ADecadeUndone.pdf){target="_blank"}. New York: Measure of America, Social Science Research Council, 2020. (Data up to 2018)

```{r, out.width="400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "A_Decade_Undone.png"))
```

The data used in these reports comes from the [American Community Survey(ASC)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs){target="_blank"}, which is the largest survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau. The survey started in 2005 and collects data for 3.5 million households annually. Data is collected about ancestry, citizehsip, income, employment, disability among many other aspects. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey){target="_blank"} for more detailed information about the survey.

According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Community_Survey){target="_blank"}:

> Data is collected by internet, mail, telephone interviews and in-person interviews...About 95 percent of households across all response modes ultimately respond... ACS responses are confidential... and "immune from legal process"

> It is a mandatory survey, it is governed by federal laws that could impose a fine of as much as $5,000 for refusing to participate.


We are particularlly interesed in the following tables on the last page of the [Measure of America 2019 report](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/Making%20the%20Connection.pdf){target="_blank"}:

```{r, echo = FALSE, gender_race_eth_2019}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "gender_race_ethnicity_overview.png"))
```

We are particularlly interesed in the tables on the following pages from the [Measure of America 2020 report](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/ADecadeUndone.pdf){target="_blank"}:


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "latinx_2018_overview.png"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "asian_2018_overview.png"))
```



## **Data Import**
*** 

One way to import data from a pdf is to use the `pdf_text()` function of the `pdftools` package. The `here()` function of the `here` package can allow us to specify where the document that we want to import is located easily, starting from the directory where a `.Rproj` file is located. In this case, we will import the `Making_the_Connection.pdf` in the `docs` directory. *Note this is the case if you pull the repository from github.*

```{r}
pdf_tools_example <- pdftools::pdf_text(here::here("docs","Making_the_Connection.pdf"))
```

We can take a look at the output for the page with our table of interests by simpy using brackets `[]` around the page number. The page we are interested in (athough called 39 in the report) is the 44th page, which looks like this:

```{r, gender_race_eth_2019, echo=FALSE}
```

#### {.scrollable }
```{r}
# Scroll through the output!
pdf_tools_example[44]
```
####

From the output, it's clear that a relatively large amount of manipulation will be required to wrangle this data. If you are interested in learning more about this method, please see this [case study](https://opencasestudies.github.io/ocs-bp-rural-and-urban-obesity/){target="_blank"} and this [case study](https://opencasestudies.github.io/ocs-bp-rural-and-urban-obesity/){target="_blank"}.

While not impossible, using the `pdftools` package in this scenario will be a bit challenging becuase of how the multiple tables are displayed on this page.

While our output may be reproducible, this process may be too time consuming.

Fortunately, there is another way we can proceed to wrangle the data. 

We will demonstrate how to produce reproducible tables with image processing software in `R` using  a package called `magick` which allows for the extraction of text from images. The advantage of this option, is that we can take a screenshot of just a piece of the page to wrangle. 

For demonstrative purposes, we will import two sets of data. The first set of data will be used to highlight common errors that the image processing software may produce. The second set of data will be used to demonstrate how to circumvent these errors and produce reproducible datasets efficiently.


### Importing with `magick`

We will now import the data using the `magick` package which allows for the improtation of images. 

First we will take a screenshot of the top part of the gender, race, and ethnicity table on the last page of the [2019 Measure of America Report](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/Making%20the%20Connection.pdf){target="_blank"}. We are only interested in the percentage of disconnection across the years, so we dont need our screenshot to include the last couple of columns.

We can show what this file looks like in this rendered rmarkdown website by using the `include_graphics()` function of the `knitr` package.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "Major_ethnic_groups_screenshot.png"))
```

Now, we will use the `image_read()` function of the `magick` package to import this image.

We can then use teh `image_info()` function to make sure that the import worked and to get information about the size, format and color of the image.

```{r, dpi = 1000}
Major_racial_ethnic_groups <- magick::image_read(here::here("img", "Major_ethnic_groups_screenshot.png"))

magick::image_info(Major_racial_ethnic_groups)
```
Now let's take a look at our image in R! Now that we have imported it to see this image, we simply need to type the name of the image.

```{r}
Major_racial_ethnic_groups
```

Nice!


Let's a couple more images just for fun. Here we will import an image directly from a URL.

```{r, out.width="20%"}
ggplot2_logo <- image_read("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2c6239d311be6d037c251c71c3902792f8c4ddd2/12f67/css/images/hex/ggplot2.png")
ggplot2_logo
```

Now we will use the `image_ocr()` function of the `magick` package to extract the text from the OCS logo image. This function uses the `tesseract` package which has tools for [optical character recognition (OCR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition){target="_blank"}, hence the `ocr` in the function name. This allows the function to identify text in images. These OCR tools have often been developed using [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning){target="_blank"} in which an algorithm was trained on images with and without text to "learn" to recognize text. See [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-ocr-ee1469a201aa){target="_blank"} to learn more about how OCR works.

```{r}
magick::image_ocr(ggplot2_logo)
```

Awesome! We were able to extract text from this hex sticker!

One thing to keep in mind is that this doesn't always work. Unusual font, angles text, or particular colors can be difficult for the OCR to recoginize.

Here is an example that does not work with the current version of `magick`:

```{r, out.width="20%"}
tidyverse_logo <- image_read("https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
tidyverse_logo
magick::image_ocr(tidyverse_logo)
```

This is likely do to the background on this particular hex sticker. So sometimes this process requires a bit of trial and error.

## **Data Wrangling**
*** 
Now let's try extracting the text from our image files.

### Major Racial and Ethnic Groups

The first image we imported looks like this. 

```{r}
Major_racial_ethnic_groups
```

Now we will extract the text! 

```{r}
major_groups <- magick::image_ocr(Major_racial_ethnic_groups)
major_groups
```
This looks like it worked fairly well!

We appear to have lost the column names but the values look pretty good.

You may notice that there are lots of `\n` values in the text from our image. These are [**newline**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline?oldformat=true) characters, which denote the end of a line of text and the start of a new line of text.  

We can use the `str_split()` function of the `stringr` package to split based on the `\n` characters in the output. We will then unlist the output using the base R `unlist()` function. By base, we mean that the function it is loaded automatically in an R session. Finally we will use the `as_tibble()` function of the `tibble` package to convert the data into [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} format, which is the tidyverse version of a data frame. This will allow us to see the values in the table much better.

To do all of these sequential steps efficiently we will use a method called piping.

***
<details> <summary>Click here if you are unfamiliar with piping in R, which uses this `%>%` operator.</summary>  

By [piping](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html){target="_blank"} we mean using the `%>%` pipe operator which is accessible after loading the `tidyverse` or several of the packages within the tidyverse like `dplyr` because they load the [`magrittr` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html){target="_blank"}. 
This allows us to perform multiple sequential steps on one data input.   
</details>  
***

```{r}
 major_groups <- major_groups %>%
  stringr::str_split(pattern ="\n") %>%
  unlist() %>%
  tibble::as_tibble()
```


#### {.scrollable }
```{r}
  
  major_groups %>%print(n = 20)

```
####


OK, this looks pretty good!

The only issue is that some values appear to be missing a decimal point. 

No worries though, we can modify the entire table in a reproducbile way to get those decimal places back. However, first we need to do some other wrangling steps first.

First, let's spearate the first column about ethnicities with the values in the subsequent columns. We can do so using the `separate()` function of the `tidyr` pacakge based on [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression){target="_blank"}. Regular expressions (abbreviated regex) are notation shortcuts that describe patterns in character strings. See [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf){target="_blank"} for an RStudio cheetsheat about them.

We want to separate by instances where a letter is followed by a space and then a number. 

We can specify any letter by using the regex `[:alpha:]` notation and any number by using the regex `[:digit]` notation. We could have listed every letter that we saw the first column ending with like so `s|e|E|O|K|N` but this would not be as reproducible (meaning maybe this would not work as well next year if a new group were added that ended in a different letter), and we might make a mistake. This is why the regex are so useful. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "alpha.png"))
```
We can indicate that we want a space by using this regex:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "regex.png"))
```


Now to specify that we want to see a letter first followed by a space, followed by a digit, we need to use a look around: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "look_around.png"))
```

We will use the "preceded by" and "followed by" look arounds. Thus `(?<=[:alpha:])` stands for any letter that appears before a space `\\s` that is followed by any digit `(?=[0-9])`. Altogether the pattern we want to separate by looks like this: `"(?<=[:alpha:])\\s(?=[0-9])"`.


Now to separate the value column into two cloumns, we can use the `separate` function of the `tidyr` pacakge to do this. This will allow us to not only split the rows by our regex expression, but also to create column names.

There are three important arguments for the `seperate()` function:  
- `col` - this specifies what column you are separating   
- `into` - this specifies the names of the new columns you are creating  
- `sep` - this specifies what character string to look for to separate by  

Thus we will separate the `value` column into `Group` and `years` columns.

```{r}
major_groups <-major_groups %>%
  tidyr::separate(col = value, into = c("Group", "Years"), sep = "(?<=[:alpha:])\\s(?=[0-9])")

major_groups
```

Looks good!

Let's also get rid of the all caps for the major categories of the `Group` column. We can convert the words to only capitalize the first letter using the `str_to_title()` function of the `stringr` package. To specifically modify the `Group` column we can use the `mutate` function of the `dplyr` package. 

We are also going to use a special pipe operator from the [`magrittr` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html){target="_blank"} called the compound assignment pipe-operator or sometimes the double pipe operator. 

This allows us to use the `major_groups` as our input and reassign it at the end after all the subsequent steps have been performed, although in this case it is only one step.

```{r}
major_groups %<>%
  mutate(Group = stringr::str_to_title(Group))

major_groups
```

Nice! That looks better.

For the year data we would like to try splitting the strings for each row into different columns based on a space. Currently all the data is listed in one column called `Years`.

We can use the `separate` function of the `tidyr` pacakge again to do this. This will allow us to split the rows by spaces, as well as provide names for the new columns. 


```{r}

major_groups %<>%
tidyr::separate(col = Years, 
               into = c("2008", "2010",
                       "2012", "2014", 
                       "2016", "2017"), 
                sep = " ")

major_groups
 
```



Looks pretty good!

We appear to have an empty row at the very end. Since all the values are `NA`, we can use the `drop_na()` function  of the `tidyr` package to remove it.

```{r}
major_groups %<>%
  tidyr::drop_na()

major_groups
```

Great, now we have 18 rows.

It's important to look very carefully at the text. Again, there are some values missing a decimal place. For example the row where the `Group` vlaue is `Asian`, the third and fourth values are missing a decimal place.

Looking at the orginal table we see that even values like 10 are represented as 10.0. 

So, to fix this we will remove all decimals (which is sort of like multiplying all values that do have a decimal by 10) and then we will multiply all values by .01 to add the decimals back. We will use the `mutate()` function combined with the `across()` function which allows us to specify which columns we want to perform a function on. We want to do this to all the year columns, so we can exclude the `Group` column by using a minus sign `-` in the `.cols` argument of the `across()` function like so: `mutate(across(.cols = -Group))`


Finally, we will use the `str_remove()` function of the `stringr` package to find instances of "." and remove them. Since "." is a regex, and indicates any character string, thus we need "\\" to have R interpret a decimal or a period instead, as we can see from the RStudio cheetsheat:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "regex_period.png"))

```

To pass the data from all the coulumns except our `Group` variable into our `str_remove()` function, we need to use the `.` notation as a replacement for the data that we specified by the `.cols`argument and we need to use `~` in front of the function name. 

```{r}

 major_groups %<>%
    mutate(across(.cols = -Group, ~str_remove(string = .,
                                             pattern = "\\.")))

major_groups
```


Great, now in order to multiply each value by 0.1 we need to first make the values numeric. Currently we can tell that they are character strings based on the `<char>` values listed under each column name.


<details> <summary> Click here for an explanation about data types in R and about character strings. </summary>

There are several classes of data in R programming. 
Character is one of these classes. 
A character string is an individual data value made up of characters. 
This can be a paragraph, like the legend for the table, or it can be a single letter or number like the letter `"a"` or the number `"3"`. 
If data are of class character, than the numeric values will not be processed like a numeric value in a mathematical sense. 
If you want your numeric values to be interpreted that way, they need to be converted to a numeric class. 
The options typically used are integer (which has no decimal place) and double precision (which has a decimal place). 

</details>


To convert our values to be numeric we can use the base `as.numeric()` function. Again we will use `mutate()` and `across()`. Since this function doesn't require any arguments, we don't need to specify it's input like we just did for the `str_remove()` but we could do so as shown below.

```{r}
major_groups %<>%
   mutate(across(.cols = -Group, as.numeric))

#this is equivalent:

#major_groups %<>%
#   mutate(across(.cols = -Group, ~as.numeric(.)))

major_groups
```

Great, we can see that the year variables are now numeric as they are now type double as indicated by the `<dbl>` below each column name. See the above section about data types if you are unfamiliar with type double.

OK, now we can multiply each value by 0.1 to add our decimal points back and get back to the orginal values.

```{r}

major_groups %<>%
    mutate(across(.cols = -Group, ~ . * 0.1))

major_groups

```

Now is a good time to double check that our table looks like what we expect.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "gender_race_ethnicity.png"))
```

Looks good!

We also want to add a couple of variables about `Race_Ethnicity` and `Gender` so that we can select across groups later.  We can use the `recode()` function of the `dplyr` package to change specific values, as we create a new `Race_Ethnicity` variable from the `Group` variable. For the Data for all of the US we want the `Race_Ethnicity` variable values to be `"All_races"`.

```{r}
major_groups %<>% 
  mutate(Race_Ethnicity = 
           recode(Group, "United States" = "All_races",
                                "Female" = "All_races",
                                  "Male" = "All_races"))

head(major_groups)
```


We also want to remove Male and Female from this "Race_Ethnicity" variable, We can do so using the `str_remove()` function of the `stringr` package. Importantly, we are also removing the space beore "Female" and "Male.

```{r}
major_groups %<>% 
  mutate(Race_Ethnicity = str_remove(string = Race_Ethnicity,  
                                    pattern = " Female| Male"))

head(major_groups)
```

For the new `Gender` variable we would like to extract just the "Female" and "Male" text from the `Group` variable. The `str_extract()` function of the `stringr` package will do this, and it will give us an `NA` value for any rows whhere "Female" or "Male" were not present. We can then replace the `NA` values with  the text "All" to represent the total value for both male and female using the `replace_na()` function of the `tidyr()` package.

```{r}

major_groups %<>% 
  mutate(Gender = str_extract(string = Group, 
                             pattern = "Female|Male")) %>%
  mutate(Gender = replace_na(Gender, replace = "All"))

head(major_groups)
```

We would also like to replace Latino and Latina with Latinx. 
We can  use another `string_r` function for this. This function, `str_replace()` allows us to remove and replace a particular pattern. 

```{r}
major_groups %<>%
  mutate(across(.cols = c(Group, Race_Ethnicity), 
                ~str_replace(string = ., 
                            pattern = "Latino|Latina",
                        replacement = "Latinx")))
```

#### {.think_question_block}
<b><u> Question Opportunity </u></b>

Why is the `str_replace()` function in this case a better option than using the `recode()` function?

####

```{r}
major_groups
```
Finally, we would like to change the shape of our table so that we have a new column that represents the year and a new column that represents the value for that year.

To do so we will be making our table "longer", meaning that it will have fewer columns and more rows. 
See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data){target="_blank"} for more information about different table formats, typically referred to as wide and long or sometimes narrow.

We will use the `pivot_longer()` function of the `tidyr` package to change the shape of our table. 

There are 3 main arguments in this function:   

1. `cols` - which specifies what columns to collapse  
2. `names_to` - which specifies the name of the new column that will be created that will contain the column names of the columns you are collapsing  
3. `values_to` - which specifies the name of the new column that will be created that will contain the values from the columns you are collapsing 

To specify that we want to collapse all the columns that have year values, we can chose those that contain the string `"20"` using the `contains()` function of `dplyr`. 

```{r}
major_groups_long <- major_groups %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = contains("20"),
                  names_to = "Year",
                 values_to = "Percent",
              names_prefix = "Perc_") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))

major_groups_long
```


Excellent, now we need to do the same for the other two tables on this page:

```{r, echo  = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "gender_race_ethnicity_overview.png"))
```


### Asian Subgroups 2017

Now let's do the same for the Asian subgroups table.

First we will start by importing a screenshot for this table without the header, as we did before. The name of the file for the screenshot is `asian_subgroups.png` and it is located in the `img` directory.

Now we again want to split the data into rows based on the newline regex. This is something we will continue to do for all the tables.

One option is to copy and paste code we wrote above each time. 
However, this is not very efficient and is error prone.
Alternatively, we can create a R function to accomplish this succinctly. 
Functions allow us to perform the same process on multiple data inputs. 
See [this other case study](https://opencasestudies.github.io/ocs-bloomberg-vaping-case-study/){target="_blank"} for more details about how to write a function.

In general, the process of writing functions involves first specifying an input that is used within the function to create an output. In this case, the data input is `text`  which will be replaced by the actual image text that we are working on, and then used in the subsequent steps to wrangle the data. We will call our function `make_rows()`.

```{r}

make_rows <- function(text){
  text %>%
  str_split("\n") %>%
  unlist() %>%
  as_tibble()
}

```


Great! Now let's apply our function to the `asian_subgroups` data!

```{r}
asian_subgroups <- make_rows(asian_subgroups) 

asian_subgroups
```


As you can see, there are some strange values for some of the rows. For example the row that starts with `CHINESE MAle` has `AT` percentage of disconnected youth, and the row that should say `FILIPINO` says `S™S™~SS`.



```{r, echo = FALSE}

temp <-asian_subgroups %>%
  pull(value) %>%
  str_split(" ")
temp[8]
temp[28]
```

The rows with no values are possibly causing this issue.  According to the PDF, these spaces are empty to denote that the estimates were unreliable for these groups.

So we will now import and extract text from three screenshots of this table where we stop just after the row that starts with `PAKISTANI` in the first image, and then an image of the Korean rows up to the next row with no values, and finally an image starting at the row that starts with `FILIPNO`.

```{r}
Asian_sub_A <- image_read(here("img", "asian_sub_A.png"))
Asian_sub_B <- image_read(here("img", "asian_sub_B.png"))
Asian_sub_C <- image_read(here("img", "asian_sub_C.png"))

Asian_sub_A
Asian_sub_B
Asian_sub_C 

```


```{r}
Asian_sub_A <- image_ocr(Asian_sub_A)
Asian_sub_B <- image_ocr(Asian_sub_B)
Asian_sub_C <- image_ocr(Asian_sub_C)

Asian_sub_A <- make_rows(Asian_sub_A)
Asian_sub_B <- make_rows(Asian_sub_B)
Asian_sub_C <- make_rows(Asian_sub_C)

Asian_sub_A 
Asian_sub_B
Asian_sub_C 
```

Much better!

We can now combine the objects with the `bind_rows()` function of the `dplyr` package, which will append each of these tibbles together one after the other.

```{r}
asian_sub_2017 <-bind_rows(Asian_sub_A, 
                           Asian_sub_B,
                           Asian_sub_C)

asian_sub_2017
```

Looks pretty good! 

Now we have similar wrangling steps to perform as we did previously and we will need to do the same for the Latinx subgroups table. So it is a good idea to make another function.

Even though we appear to have all of the decimal places for the values, we will include this in our function, just to make sure the data is correct.

                               "Female" = "All_races",
                                 "Male" = "All_races")) %>%

                        pattern ="Female|Male")) %>%
    mutate(Gender = replace_na(Gender, replace = "All"))
 
}

```



```{r}

### Latinx Subgroups 2017

```

#### {.think_question_block}

Do you notice anything incorrect about this table?

Sometimes when wrangling text data, we will come across a typo. We need to determine how to respond to the typo and make note of it. It's often best to consult a secondary source to confirm that changes made are accurate. 

For the purposes of this case study, we will assume that the first of the two rows represents male disconnection rates in the Latino/a subgroup; this would be consistent with the ordering of genders in the previous subgroups. 

We will make sure to correct this typo when we can. 


After trial and error, two screenshots were determined best for importing this data. The names of the files for the screenshots are `latinx_sub_A.png` and `"latinx_sub_B.png`. They are located in the `img` directory.

Now we are ready to look at the data from 2018 for the Asian and Latinx subgroups from the other [report](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/ADecadeUndone.pdf){target="_blank"}.


### Asian Subgroups 2018

Recall that this was the page with the table of interest for the asian subgroups with 2018 data:

```{r, echo = FALSE, }
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "asian_2018_overview.png"))
```

As you can see, the data for the subgroups is shown in the table but the overall data for Asians is located in the text.

We will use a screenshot of each to extract the data for this year.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img/asian_subgroups_2018.png"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "asian_youth_excerpt.png"))
```
Trial and error indicated that again dividing the table into multiple screenshots improved the text extraction:

```{r}
asian_sub_2018_A <- image_read(here::here("img", "asian_sub_2018_A.png"))
asian_sub_2018_A <- image_ocr(asian_sub_2018_A)
asian_sub_2018_B <- image_read(here::here("img", "asian_sub_2018_B.png"))
asian_sub_2018_B <- image_ocr(asian_sub_2018_B)
asian_sub_2018 <-str_c(asian_sub_2018_A, asian_sub_2018_B)
```

```{r}
asian_sub_2018 <- make_rows(asian_sub_2018)

asian_sub_2018
```
Now we need to modify our function a bit for this new data. 

Firstly, we now have colons `:` in our table that we will want to separate by. Unfortunately, the text in each row isn't extracted in the same way by the OCR.Thus some rows have only a space, while others have spaces around a colon; or for the row with `VIETNAM` we see a colon directly after the word followed by a space. Thus we will modify our `seperate()` function with this change. We can specify  that the separator between any letter and any digit should be either a space (`\\s`) or a colon with a space before and after it (`\\s:\\s`) using the or (`|`)opperator. 

So this will look like this:

```{r}
asian_sub_2018 %>%
    separate(., col = value,
               into = c("Group", "Percent"), 
                sep =  "(?<=[:alpha:])\\s:\\s|\\s(?=[0-9])")

```
Then because of the row with `VIETNAM`, we will want to remove this colon using the `str_remove()` function like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
asian_sub_2018 %>%
    separate(., col = value, 
               into = c("Group", "Percent"), 
                sep = "(?<=[:alpha:])\\s:\\s|\\s(?=[0-9])") %>% 
    mutate(Group= str_remove(string = Group, pattern = ":"))

```

The other difference from the previous function, is that we want to fill in a new `Race_Ethnicity` variable with the previous rows. We can do so by first replacing "Men" or "Women" which with the or operator is ("Men|Women"), with "missing". Then we need to convert these to `NA` values using the `na_if()` function of the `dplyr` package, we just need to specify what column to modify and what value to change to `NA`. Finally we will then repace the `NA` values with the previous non-`NA` value using the `fill()` function of the `tidyr` package. Note that this does not work inside of the `mutate()` function. We just need to simply specify what column to modify and then the direction to replace values. In this case we want to replace in the downward direction using the previous values. 

This will look like this:

```{r}

asian_sub_2018 %>%
separate(., col = value, 
           into = c("Group", "Percent"), 
            sep = "(?<=[:alpha:])\\s:\\s|\\s(?=[0-9])") %>%
mutate(Group = str_remove(string = Group, pattern = ":")) %>%
mutate(Race_Ethnicity = str_replace(string = Group,
                                   pattern = "Men|Women", 
                               replacement = "missing")) %>%
head()

asian_sub_2018 %>%
separate(., col = value, 
           into = c("Group", "Percent"), 
            sep = "(?<=[:alpha:])\\s:\\s|\\s(?=[0-9])") %>%
mutate(Group = str_remove(string = Group, pattern = ":")) %>%
mutate(Race_Ethnicity = str_replace(string = Group,
                                   pattern = "Men|Women", 
                               replacement = "missing")) %>%
mutate(Race_Ethnicity = na_if(Race_Ethnicity, "missing")) %>%
head()

asian_sub_2018 %>%
separate(., col = value, 
           into = c("Group", "Percent"), 
            sep = "(?<=[:alpha:])\\s:\\s|\\s(?=[0-9])") %>%
mutate(Group = str_remove(string = Group, pattern = ":")) %>%
mutate(Race_Ethnicity = str_replace(string = Group,
                                   pattern = "Men|Women", 
                               replacement = "missing")) %>%
mutate(Race_Ethnicity = na_if(Race_Ethnicity, "missing")) %>%
fill(Race_Ethnicity, .direction = "down") %>%
head()

```

OK! Now, let's combine these pieces of our new function with the old pieces:

```{r}

clean_table <- function(table){
  table %>%
    separate(., col = value, 
               into = c("Group", "Percent"), 
                sep =  "(?<=[:alpha:])\\s:\\s|\\s(?=[0-9])") %>% 
    mutate(Group= str_remove(string = Group, 
                            pattern = ":")) %>%
    drop_na() %>%
    mutate(Group = str_to_title(string = Group)) %>%
    mutate(Percent = str_remove(string = Percent, 
                               pattern = "\\.")) %>%
    mutate(Percent = as.numeric(Percent)) %>%
    mutate(Percent = Percent * 0.1) %>%
    mutate(Race_Ethnicity = str_replace(string = Group,
                                       pattern = "Men|Women", 
                                   replacement = "missing")) %>%

                               pattern = "Men|Women")) %>%
    mutate(Gender = replace_na(Gender, replace = "All"))
}

```


```{r}
asian_sub_2018 <-clean_table(asian_sub_2018)
asian_sub_2018
```

Looking good!


Now we just need to add the data for all Asians from the text. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "asian_youth_excerpt.png"))
```

We can do this using the `add_row()` function of the `dplyr()` package.

```{r}
asian_sub_2018 %<>%
  add_row(Group = "Asian",
        Percent = 6.2,
 Race_Ethnicity = "Asian",
         Gender = "All") %>%
  add_row(Group = "Asian",
        Percent = 6.4,
 Race_Ethnicity = "Asian",
         Gender = "Men") %>%
  add_row(Group = "Asian",
        Percent = 6.1,
 Race_Ethnicity = "Asian",
         Gender = "Women")

asian_sub_2018
```

OK, now we just want to combine the 2018 data and the 2017 data for the asian subgroups.

First let's add a varaible for year to both. Using `mutate()` we can add a variable `Year` where all values are `2017` like so:

```{r}
asian_sub_2017 %<>%
  mutate(Year = 2017)
asian_sub_2017 
```

```{r}
asian_sub_2018 %<>%
  mutate(Year = 2018)
asian_sub_2018
```

You may notice that `Gender` is coded differently for the two years. Let's make this consistent now:

```{r}
asian_sub_2018 %<>%
  mutate(across(.cols = c(Gender, Group),
               ~ str_replace(string = ., 
                            pattern = "Men", 
                        replacement = "Male")),
         across(.cols = c(Gender, Group),
               ~ str_replace(string = ., 
                            pattern = "Women", 
                        replacement = "Female")))

```

We can combine these two tibbles using the `bind_rows()` function of `dplyr`. 

```{r}

asian_subgroups <- bind_rows(asian_sub_2017, asian_sub_2018)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(asian_subgroups)
```



Notice that there are some cases where we only have one value for a praticular group. For example, there are no male or female values for the Pakistani data.

We would like to have `NA` values for the comprable years/genders that are possible. We can fill out the rest of the table with `NA` values by performing the `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` functions sequentially like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

asian_subgroups %<>% 
select(-Group) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Percent) %>%
pivot_longer(cols = -c(Race_Ethnicity, Gender), 
names_to ="Year" , 
values_to="Percent")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(asian_subgroups)
```


Great, now we are ready to peform similar wrangling for the Latinx subgroups.

### Latinx Subgroups 2018 

Recall that this was the page with the table of interest for the Latinx subgroup 2018 data:

```{r, echo = FALSE, }
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "latinx_2018_overview.png"))
```

In this case only a single image was needed:

```{r}
latinx_sub_2018 <- image_read(here::here("img", "latinx_subgroups_2018.png"))
latinx_sub_2018 <- image_ocr(latinx_sub_2018)
latinx_sub_2018
```

Let's first combine the South and Central American labels. Notice that there are multiple new line expressions in between and we dont see repeated `\n` characters elsewhere.
We can replace the pattern of exactly two `\n` (using `\n{2}` to specify exactly 2) or two newline regex with a space and colon in front with a single space.

```{r}
latinx_sub_2018 <- str_replace_all(string = latinx_sub_2018, 
                                  pattern = "\\s:\n{2}|\n{2}",                                               replacement = " ")
latinx_sub_2018 
```


```{r}
latinx_sub_2018 <- make_rows(latinx_sub_2018 )

latinx_sub_2018
```


```{r}
latinx_sub_2018 <-clean_table(latinx_sub_2018)
latinx_sub_2018
```


Again we will replace `Pr, Dr, Cuban`:
```{r}
latinx_sub_2018 %<>%
  mutate(Group = 
           str_replace(string = Group,
                      pattern = "Pr, Dr, Cuban",
                  replacement = "Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban"), 
          Race_Ethnicity = 
           str_replace(string = Race_Ethnicity,
                      pattern = "Pr, Dr, Cuban",
                  replacement = "Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban"))

```



We also want to add the total Latinx values according to the text:



```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "latinx_youth_excerpt.png"))

```


#### {.recall_code_question_block}
<b><u> Question Opportunity </u></b>

Can you recall how to add additional rows?

####


<details> <summary> Click here to reveal the code. </summary>


```{r}
latinx_sub_2018 %<>%
  add_row(Group = "Latinx",
        Percent = 12.8,
 Race_Ethnicity = "Latinx",
         Gender = "All") %>%
  add_row(Group = "Latinx",
        Percent = 12.3,
 Race_Ethnicity = "Latinx",
         Gender = "Men") %>%
  add_row(Group = "Latinx",
        Percent = 13.3,
 Race_Ethnicity = "Latinx",
         Gender = "Women")
```

</details>


```{r}
tail(latinx_sub_2018)
```

And now we will recode gender like before to be consistent:

```{r}
latinx_sub_2018 %<>%
  mutate(across(.cols = c(Gender, Group),
                ~ str_replace(string = ., 
                             pattern = "Men", 
                         replacement = "Male")),
         across(.cols = c(Gender, Group),
                ~ str_replace(string = ., 
                             pattern = "Women", 
                         replacement = "Female")))

head(latinx_sub_2018)
```



Now we just need to combine all the data for the Latinx subgroups.


Again, first we will add a year variable to both the 2017 and 2018 data.

```{r}
latinx_sub_2017 %<>%
  mutate(Year = 2017)

latinx_sub_2018 %<>%
  mutate(Year = 2018)

latinx_subgroups <- bind_rows(latinx_sub_2017, latinx_sub_2018)
latinx_subgroups
```


Again, we would like to have `NA` values for the comprable years/genders that are possible. We will fill out the rest of the table with `NA` values by performing the `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` functions sequentially like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

latinx_subgroups %<>% 
select(-Group) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Percent) %>%
pivot_longer(cols = -c(Race_Ethnicity, Gender), 
names_to ="Year" , 
values_to="Percent")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(asian_subgroups)
```

### Checking the data

OK, now let's make sure that our notations match across our different tables. For example in the first report the terms male and female where used, but in the second report men and women were used. Let's make sure everything is consistent now.

```{r}
major_groups_long
asian_subgroups
latinx_subgroups
```

Looks good!

```{r, echo= FALSE, eval = TRUE}
save(major_groups_long, asian_subgroups, latinx_subgroups,
     file = here::here("data", "wrangled_data.rda"))

```

## **Data Visualization**
*** 

Recall what our main questions were?


#### {.main_question_block}
<b><u> Our main questions: </u></b>

1) How have youth disconnection rates in American youth changed since 2008?   
2) In particular, how has this changed for different gender and ethnic groups? Are any groups particularly disconnected? 

####

Now that we have wrangled our data and made it easy to work with, let's create some visualizations to explore these questions.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# To allow starting at this section:
load(here::here("data", "wrangled_data.rda"))
```



### Major Race and Ethnic Groups Plot

We are particularly interested in being able to reproduce the plot below, as we would like to make similar plots but while also including gender subgroups.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.align ="center"}
include_graphics(here::here("img", "Making_the_Connection_plot.png"))
```

In general, it is very useful to learn how to reproduce the style of a plot.


There are color identifying websites such as [this](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/).

Using one of these websites, we identify the [hex triplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors?oldformat=true) code for the color used in the visualization included in the PDF : `#008393`.  Thus we will use this color our plot.


We can create a version of the above plot using the `ggplot2` package of the _tidyverse_ to create our plots.

***
<details><summary> Click here for an introduction about this package if you are  new to using `ggplot2` </summary>

The [ggplot2 package](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) is generally intuitive for beginners because it is based on a  [grammar of graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) or the `gg` in `ggplot2`. 
The idea is that you can construct many sentences by learning just a few nouns, adjectives, and verbs. There are specific “words” that we will need to learn and once we do, you will be able to create (or “write”) hundreds of different plots.

The critical part to making graphics using `ggplot2` is the data needs to be in a _tidy_ format. 
Given that we have just spent time putting our data in _tidy_ format, we are primed to take advantage of all that `ggplot2` has to offer! 

We will show how it is easy to pipe _tidy_ data (output) as input to other functions that create plots. 
This all works because we are working 
within the _tidyverse_. 

**What is the `ggplot()` function?** 
As explained by Hadley Wickham:

> The grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinates system.

`ggplot2` Terminology: 

- **ggplot** - the main function where you specify the dataset and variables to plot (this is where we define the `x` and
`y` variable names)
- **geoms** - geometric objects
    - e.g. `geom_point()`, `geom_bar()`, `geom_line()`, `geom_histogram()`
- **aes** - aesthetics
    - shape, transparency, color, fill, line types
- **scales** - define how your data will be plotted
    - continuous, discrete, log, etc

The function `aes()` is an aesthetic mapping function inside the `ggplot()` object. 
We use this function to specify plot attributes (e.g. `x` and `y` variable names) that will not change as we add more layers.  

Anything that goes in the `ggplot()` object becomes a global setting. 
From there, we use the `geom` objects to add more layers to the base `ggplot()` object. 
These will define what we are interested in illustrating using the data.

</details>

***

So for this first plot we just want to recreate the plot in the PDF. Thus we will use the `major_groups_long` tibble and we will filter for the `"All"` values of the `Gender` package. We also want to exclude the data for the United states. 
We can exclude the data from the US using the not equals `!=` opperator like so:

```{r}
major_groups_long %>%
   filter(Gender == "All",
          Group != "United States")
```

The data from the tables only included up to 2017, but this will still allow us to create a similar plot.

Now we have the data ready to make the plot... but how do we actually start making the plot?

First, we start with the `ggplot()` function of the `ggplot2` package.

This function requires that the aesthetics `aes()` be specified. This involves choosing what variable will be plotted on the x-axis and the y axis. It also involves choosing variables to color or group our plot by. 

In our case, we want to plot the percent of disconnection on the y-axis (thus the `Percent` varaible of the `major_groups_long` data) and the Year on the x-axis. We would like to separate each racial or ethnic group to have their own points/lines. Thus we will use the `color` argument for this variable to do this, as we intend to color our plot something other than black.

If we run the following code, we get an empty plot.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
major_groups_long %>%
   filter(Gender == "All",
          Group != "United States") %>%
ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Percent, color = Race_Ethnicity))

```


The next thing we need to do is add `ggplot2` layers using the `+` to specify how we want the data to be displayed on our plot.

We would like both points and lines. We will use the `geom_point()` and `geom_line()` functions of the `ggplot2` package to do this. Which ever layer we add first will be plotted first and therefore below the next layer. We will also specify the size of these elements using the `size` argument.

```{r}

major_groups_long %>%
   filter(Gender == "All",
          Group != "United States") %>%
ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Percent, color = Race_Ethnicity)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 3) 

```


OK, not bad, but we have quite a bit to work on to make the style match.

First, we will update the x-axis and y-axis, to look more similar to the plot from the report. We can specify where the tick marks should be for each using `breaks` argument of the `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()` functions (also of the `ggplot2` package). These functions also allow for specification of the range or limits of the axis using the `limits` argument. We can use the base `seq()` function to create a sequence of numbers for each tick mark.
We will make the x-axis upper limit a bit larger to allow for the image of the figure and the label for each group.

Next, we will change the color to match the one that we identified, by using the `scale_color_manual()` function of the `ggplot2` package. This requires color values for each group. In our case, we have 5 groups, so we repeate this value 5 times using the base `rep()` function.

We will also change the overall look of the plot using the `theme_classic()` function. See [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html){target="_blank"} for a list of options.

```{r}
 major_groups_long %>%
   filter(Gender == "All",
          Group != "United States") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Percent, color = Race_Ethnicity)) +
  geom_line( size = 0.5) +
  geom_point( size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2008,2018, by=1),
                     limits = c(2008,2020)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(5,30, by =5),
                     limits = c(5,30)) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(rep( "#008393", 5)))

```

Now let's add some labels. We can add a title using the `title` argument and a y-axis title using the `y` argument of the `labs()` function.
```{r}
 plot <-major_groups_long %>%
   filter(Gender == "All",
          Group != "United States") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Percent, color = Race_Ethnicity)) +
  geom_line( size = 0.5) +
  geom_point( size = 3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2008,2018, by=1),
                     limits = c(2008,2020)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(5,30, by =5),
                     limits = c(5,30)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "YOUTH DISCONNECTION BY RACE AND ETHNICITY, 2008 - 2017",
       y = "YOUTH DISCONNECTION (%)") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 10,
                             color = "#008393",
                             face = "bold"),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())+
  scale_color_manual(values = c(rep( "#008393", 5)))

plot <- directlabels::direct.label(plot, list(dl.trans(x = x+1.2, y = y +0), "last.points"))

plot
```

Getting close!


Now we need to add figurine icons to the plot.  

To add the figurines we can use icons from free resources like [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/){target="_blank"}. See [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Font_Awesome_4_icons){target="_blank"} for a link to `svg` options. Or we could also take a screenshot of just the figurine from the original plot. However, it is useful to know how to create similar icons if we didn't have the orginal plot to work with. 

##### Using font awesome:
```{r, out.width="10%"}

fa_figurine <- image_read("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/User_font_awesome.svg")

fa_figurine

fa_figurine <- image_fill(fa_figurine,
                          color = "#008393", 
                          point = "+800+800",
                          fuzz = 0)
fa_figurine
fa_figurine <- image_fill(fa_figurine,
                          color = "#008393", 
                          point = "+800+1000",
                          fuzz = 0)

fa_figurine
```

#### Using a screenshot:
```{r, out.width= "10%"}

figurine <-image_read(here::here("img", "figurine.png"))
figurine
```

Now to add the image of the figurine to the plot we can use the `draw_image()` function of the `cowplot` package. We simply need to specify the name of the image, and then where we would like it to go according to the x- and y-axis and finaly the scaled size of the image. This `scale` argument takes a bit of trial and error. 

Here we will add both images of the figurines to a couple of groups:

```{r}

plot +
  cowplot::draw_image(figurine, x = 2017, y = 23.5, scale = 4) +
  cowplot::draw_image(fa_figurine, x = 2017, y = 17.5, scale = 2)


```

Nice!

Now we just need to add this for all of the groups and we also will want to replace our `Native American` label with a two line version so that we look as similar to the report plot as possible.

#### {.think_question_block}
<b><u> Question Opportunity </u></b>

How might we change the Native American label to have two lines? (hint: think about how we separated the rows of our tables)

```

</details>

```{r}
plot
```
Nice! Our plot looks very similar stylistically to the plot in the report. 

We can see from this plot that Native Americans have a very high rate of youth disconnection, with roughly still a quarter of the population experiencing youth disconnection in this survey. Altough some groups show a downward trend, like the Latinx group, the level has been fairly stable since 2008, as we see that the slope of each line is fairly flat. We will investigate this further in our analysis. 

### Major Race and Ethnic Groups and Gender Plot

Now let's create a similar plot for females and males. To do this we can simply use the `facet_wrap()` function. We need to specify what variable we want to facet by, in this case the `Gender` variable, by using the `~` symbol. We also want to set the `scales` argument to `"free"`, so that we have a y-axis for both the female and male plots. See this [case study](https://opencasestudies.github.io/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/#Faceted_plots){target="_blank"} for more information about faceting plots.

We also dont want to plot the `"All"` values for the `Gender` variable as we have already shown that in the previous plot, so we again exclude it.

It's a bit difficult to tell the Black female and Latinx female lines apart. 

Let's try adding another color for every other line. Again we will use the `scale_color_manual()` function to specify the colors of the lines and points on the plot.  

We will use black as the other color. We can use the [hex triplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors?oldformat=true) code or we can write out the name of the color, in this case we will write `"black"`. 
To specifically color each group differently, we can write the colors in the alphabetically order of the distinct values of `Race_Ethnicity`. Thus the first color listed will be the color for the `Asian` values, while the last will be the color for the `White` values.


```{r}
plot_gender <- plot_gender  +
 scale_color_manual(values =c("#008393","black","#008393", "#008393", "black"))
```

Can you explain why we didn't use a pipe in the previous code chunk?

```{r}
plot_gender
```
Very interesting! By parsing the groups further into intersections of racial and ethnic groups with gender, we see that there are some very dramatic differences for the Black and Latinx groups. One postive thing that we cans see, is that there has been a steep decline in youth disconnection for Latinx females. Unfortunately the level of disconnection for females in 2008 was quite high, so now Latinx females have similar rates to Latinx males. In contrast, we see that Black males have had and continue to have much higher rates of disconnection than Black females. Both Black females and males show an increased rate since 2016. Native American females also show an increased rate since 2016. 


### Subgroup plots

It is clear from the previous plot that observing more specific subgroups in our data can be very informative!

Thus, we also want to make plots of the Asain and Latinx subgroups, to see if there are particular ethnic groups that have higher levels of youth disconnection. If so, these groups may particuarly benefit for prevention and rengagement efforts.

We will also attempt to continue to plot the genders separately, as we have learned that there may be important gender group differences among the racial and ethnic groups. However, the data is incomplete for some of the ethnic groups. Recall that we also only have two years of data for both our Asian and Latinx subgroup data. So first we will start by plotting just the subgroups over the two years.



We can continue to make our plots look like they match the report by using a custom color palette to create a gradient based off the color  used in the report. 

This color can be based on the current color. We can use the `colorRampPalette()` function of the `grDevices` package, which is loaded automatically in an RStudio session. We can specify that we want the colors to range from white to the color that we have been using to black.

Then we just need to specify how many colors we want in our gradient. There are three gender groups, and we would like to plot each of these for our subgroups, so let's use 3 colors. Thus we will have gray, the teal color we have been using, and a shade in between.


```{r}
custom_pal <- colorRampPalette(c("#008393", "gray"))

custom_pal(3)
```
Here we can see the [hex triplet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors?oldformat=true) codes for gray and the shade in between. 

It's hard to tell yet what the major group differences will be in our data, so first we will try plotting as many of the groups as possible and go from there. 

We will use the colors of our custom pallate to create a plot of the asain subgroups.

```

This shows the importance of adding small details such as the US and Asian rate lines. This helps provide a simple yet nuanced picture of what is going on. 

From the above plot, it becomes readily apparent that the Hmong subgroup has much higher disconnection rates than the other Asian subgroups, as well as all races/ethnicities in the US combined. 


We can confirm this by revisiting the table.

```{r, eval = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("img", "asian_2017_overview.png"))

```

From the table, we can caluculate that the Hmong group represents `r round((8300*100)/145600)`% of all Asian disconnected youth.

Now we want to show data for both 2017 and 2018 for the subgroups. We want to drop groups where there is only one year worth of values.

## **Data Analysis**
*** 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# To allow starting at this section:
load(here::here("data", "wrangled_data.rda"))
```

**Repeated Cross-sectional Data**

We have pooled (repeated) [cross-sectional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_data?oldformat=true) data.

This is data produced from repeated measurement of a [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population?oldformat=true) over time.

It is often infeasible to collect data for an entire population at once. However, we can still obtain meaningful measures using a random [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)?oldformat=true) of the population. 

At specific time-points, data is collected from a sample of the population. The individuals in each sample are not necessarily the same individuals. This separates pooled cross-sectional data from panel data, which is longitudinal data from repeated measurement of the same people.   

By sampling from a population at multiple time points, we can generate population level statistics. Although these statistics have some random error, they can provide insight into how the measure variable is changing in a population over time.

We can accomplish this by plotting the measured values over time. Sometimes, however, the trend isn't exactly clear. Fortunately, there are statistical methods to resolve this issue.

The Mann-Kendall trend test—a variation of the [Kendall rank correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient?oldformat=true)—tests whether there is a monotonic association, an association that does not increase or decrease but remains static across a dimension.

Recall the youth disconnection rates for Native Americans, some of the highest in the first table we examined. 

```{r}
Major_racial_ethnic_groups
```

Let's conduct a Mann-Kendall test for trend.

We can accomplish this with the `Kendall::MannKendall()` function. The `Kendall::MannKendall()` accepts a vector of data for which a trend may be observed. [Consulting the documentation for the `Kendall::MannKendall()` function available on CRAN](https://rdrr.io/cran/Kendall/man/MannKendall.html), we can "test for a a monotonic trend in a time series".



```{r}
major_groups_long %>%
  filter(Gender == "All",
 Race_Ethnicity == "Native American") %>%
  pull(Percent) %>%
  MannKendall(.) %>%
  summary()

```


There does not appear to be a change in the trend. However, it's important to note that we only have `r length(major_groups_long %>% filter(Gender == "All", Race_Ethnicity == "Native American") %>% pull(Percent))` observations.

We can also explore the trend using [simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression?oldformat=true). 


```{r}
major_groups_long %>%
  filter(Gender == "All",
 Race_Ethnicity == "Native American") %>%
  lm(Percent ~ Year, data = .) %>%
  summary()
```


For each one year change, the mean increase in disconnection rates is
`r (major_groups_long%>% filter(Gender == "All", Race_Ethnicity == "Native American") %>% lm(Percent ~ Year, data = .))[["coefficients"]]["Year"]`

 This relationship is not statistically significant. Again, we are largely limited by the number of observations in this dataset. 

We can visualize the relationship above.

```{r}
major_groups_long %>%
  filter(Gender == "All",
 Race_Ethnicity == "Native American") %>%

                     limits = c(2008, 2018)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Youth Disconnection Rates of Native American Youth",
       subtitle = "2008 - 2017",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Disconnection Rate")
```


As we can see, there is a large amount of uncertainty around the fitted line.
