### Title 

Disparities in Youth Disconnection

### Motivation 

According to this [report](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/Making%20the%20Connection.pdf) youth disconnection (defined as "young people between the ages of **16 and 24** who are **neither working nor in school**" according to the [Measure of America](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/view/moa/) (a nonpartisan project) although generally showing decreasing trends for the past 7 years, shows **racial and ethnic disparities**, where some groups are showing increased rates of disconnection.

Thus in this case study we aim to look further at youth disconnection rates among gender and racial and ethnic subgroups to identify groups that may be particularly vulnerable. 

### Motivating questions

1) How have youth disconnection rates in American youth changed since 2008?   
2) In particular, how has this changed for different gender and ethnic groups? Are any groups particularly disconnected?

### Data

In this case study we will be using data related to youth disconnection from the two following reports from the [Measure of America](https://www.ssrc.org/programs/view/moa/) project:

> Measure of America is a nonpartisan project of the nonprofit [Social Science Research Council](https://www.ssrc.org/) founded in 2007 to create easy-to-use yet methodologically sound tools for understanding well-being and opportunity in America. Through reports, interactive apps, and custom-built dashboards, Measure of America works with partners to breathe life into numbers, using data to identify areas of highest need, pinpoint levers for change, and track progress over time.

These reports use data from the [American Community Survey (ASC)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs).

#### Learning Objectives

Data science skills:  

1. Importing text from PDF files using images and the `magick` package  
2. Apply action verbs in `dplyr` for data wrangling  
3. How to reshape data by pivoting between "long" and "wide" formats and separating columns into additional columns (`tidyr`)  
4. How to fill in data based on previous values (`tidyr`)
5. How to create data visualizations with `ggplot2` that are in a similar style to an existing image    
6. How to add images to plots using `cowplot`
7. How to create effective bar plots to for multiple comparisons, including adding gaps between bars in bar plots, adding figure legends to the plot area, and adding comparison lines (`ggplot2`)

Statistical concepts and methods:  

1. Implementation of the Mann-Kendall trend test  
2. Interpretation of the Mann-Kendall trend test 
3. Difference between linear regression and Mann-Kendall trend test


#### Data import 

Data is imported from several tables within two PDF documents by taking screenshots of the tables of interest and using the `magick` package to import the text from the screenshots.

#### Data wrangling 

This case study particularly focuses on renaming variables, modifying variables, creating new variables, and modifying the shape of the data using functions such as as: `pivot_longer()`, and `pivot_wider()`,  as well as modifying specific variables using the `mutate()` and `across()` functions of the `dplyr` package.  
This case study also covers combining data with `bind_rows()` and `add_rows()` functions of the `dplyr` package.

We also cover removing NA values with the `drop_na()` function of the `tidyr` package, separating one column into multiple columns using the `separate()` function of the `tidyr` package, filling in `NA` values based on previous values using the `fill()` and  replacing `NA` values with the `replace_na()` function, both of the `tidyr` package, as well as arranging levels of factors using the  `forcats` package. 

Finally, this case study also covers many of the `stringr` functions to manipulate character strings, including `str_extract()`, `str_to_title()`, `str_replace()`, `str_remove()`.


#### Data Visualization

We include an example of creating a plot to match the style of a plot in an existing report. We also demonstrate how to make effective bar plots, by demonstrating details such as creating gaps between groups, taking advantage of these gaps to move the legend to within the plot area, and to use horizontal lines to allow for additional comparisons among groups. We also demonstrate how to add images to plots and combine plots using the `patchwork` package.

### Analysis 

The analysis in this case study covers some basics about probability and hypothesis testing, as well as the Mann-Kendall trend test and the difference between this test and simple linear regression. In this analysis we use the Mann-Kendall to test if there has been a trend within the disconnection rates of particular groups of youths over time.

#### For users 

There is a [`Makefile`](Makefile) in this folder that allows you to type `make` to knit the case study contained in the `index.Rmd` to `index.html` and it will also knit the [`README.Rmd`](README.Rmd) to a markdown file (`README.md`). 

#### For instructors

Instructors can start at the Data Visualization or Data Analysis sections. Instructors can also skip the *Subgroup plots* section if they don't wish to instruct students about making bar plots in depth.

#### Target audience 

This case study is appropriate for those new to R programming and new to statistics. It is also appropriate for more advanced R users who are new to the Tidyverse. This particular case study may require some fundamental knowledge of statistics.

#### Suggested homework

- For the Asian and Latinx subgroup bar plots made across year, modify these plots to consider gender differences (instead of across time).
- Taking the plot you made above, modify the plot to facet across years. 
- Find another table in one of the reports to import using the `magick` package (for example perhaps the data about different states over time in the 2019 report called [Making the Connection](https://ssrc-static.s3.amazonaws.com/moa/Making%20the%20Connection.pdf)). Look for differences between groups by plotting the data and evaluating with the Mann-Kendall test.
